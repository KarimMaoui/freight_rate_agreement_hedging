# Freight Rate Agreement Hedging Simulation 

This Python project simulates the performance of Freight Rate Agreements (FRAs) as hedging instruments against freight rate volatility. It models freight rate paths, applies FRA contracts, and evaluates their P&L impact under various market conditions.

##  Use Case

Shipping companies and commodity traders are exposed to fluctuations in freight rates. This project models how FRA contracts can hedge such exposure.

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/freight_rate_agreement_hedging.git
cd freight_rate_agreement_hedging

# (Optional) Create a virtual environment

Nota Bene: Even though FRA payoffs are linear and volatility has little impact on average P&L, risk managers still care about dispersion of outcomes. This project visualizes both dimensions.
